# Bug Fix Documentation

## Issue Description
The login form wasn't properly handling form submission events. The form had a submit button but was missing the `onSubmit` handler to process the form data and call the `onLogin` prop.

## Solution
This was fixed by:
1. Adding a `handleSubmit` function that prevents the default form submission
2. Calling the `onLogin` prop with the form data
3. Adding the `onSubmit` handler to the form element

## Implementation Details
The fix was implemented in `LoginForm.js` by adding:
```javascript
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  onLogin(formData);
};
```
And updating the form element to include the handler:
```javascript
<form className="login-form" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
```

## Testing
The fix was verified using Cypress tests that confirm:
- The login form works as expected
- Successful login leads to proper redirection
- The welcome page displays the correct user information
