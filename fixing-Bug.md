Bug Fix Documentation
Issue Description
The login form was not redirecting the user after a successful login. Although the form allowed input and submission, the app did not navigate to the welcome page as expected. This was because the login logic only updated state without triggering a navigation or redirect.

Solution
The issue was resolved by:

Integrating react-router-dom for client-side routing.

Using the useNavigate hook inside the handleLogin function in App.js to programmatically redirect the user to the welcome page after login.

Implementation Details
The fix involved:

Installing react-router-dom and setting up routing in App.js.

Updating handleLogin in App.js:

js
Copy
Edit
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
const navigate = useNavigate();

const handleLogin = (formData) => {
setIsLoggedIn(true);
setUserName(formData.name);
navigate('/welcome'); // Redirect after login
};

// ...
}
Adding route definitions to render the LoginForm at / and Welcome at /welcome.

Testing
The fix was verified using Cypress end-to-end tests which confirmed:

The login form renders correctly.

A successful login redirects the user to the welcome page.

The welcome page displays the correct username.

The logout button is visible after login.
