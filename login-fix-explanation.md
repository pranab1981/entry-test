## ðŸ›  Bug Explanation

The main issue was that the `onLogin` function was not being called when the form was submitted, and there was no `handleSubmit` function to handle the login logic. I fixed this by adding a `handleSubmit` function that calls `onLogin` with the correct parameters when the form is submitted.

For this challenge, I mainly relied on Copilot autocompletion since the solution was straightforward.

## âœ… Cypress Test
